# Swift_DevOps_Integration
This project aims to rapidly implement a DevOps lifecycle organization-wide: using Ansible for provisioning, establishing a streamlined Git workflow, integrating Jenkins for automated testing/deployment, Dockerizing for containerization, setting up Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD, and integrating Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring/analytics.
