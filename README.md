# Swift DevOps Integration: Automating Deployment for Rapid Delivery
This project aims to implement a DevOps lifecycle across our organization swiftly. It involves provisioning essential software through Ansible, establishing an efficient Git workflow, integrating Jenkins for automated testing and deployment, Dockerizing the application for containerization, and setting up a Jenkins pipeline for seamless CI/CD processes. Additionally, it includes the integration of Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities.

## Project Requirements
Infrastructure Setup:
1. Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 
2. Instances:
    - Master Node
    - 2 Worker Nodes (Slaves)

Networking Requirements:
1. Communication: Ensure all nodes can communicate with each other over the network.
2. Ports: Open necessary ports(jenkins:8080, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) as per security best practices.

Hardware Requirements
1. Minimum Configuration(t2.micro):
   - CPU: 1v
   - Memory: 1 GiB
2. Recommended Configuration(t2.medium)
   - CPU: 2v
   - Memory: 4 GiB


## Installation

1. Installing Ansible on Ubuntu:(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html#installing-ansible-on-ubuntu)
2. Installing Jenkins on Ubuntu:(https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu)
3. Installing Java on Ubuntu: (sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre)
4. Installing Docker on Ubuntu: (sudo apt install docker.io) 

## Usage

1. Efficient Infrastructure Provisioning: Using Ansible, you can automate the provisioning of essential software and configurations across your infrastructure. This ensures consistency and reduces the time required for manual setup, leading to faster deployment of environments.

2. Streamlined Git Workflow: By establishing an efficient Git workflow, teams can collaborate seamlessly on code changes, track revisions, and ensure version control. This enhances code quality, facilitates code reviews, and reduces the risk of conflicts in development.

3. Automated Testing and Deployment: Integrating Jenkins enables automated testing and deployment pipelines. This automation accelerates the release process, improves reliability by detecting issues early in the development cycle, and ensures that deployments are consistent and repeatable.

4. Containerization with Docker: Dockerizing applications allow for efficient deployment and scaling across different environments, from development to production. It provides isolation, simplifies dependency management, and promotes a microservices architecture, enhancing flexibility and resource utilization.

5. CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins: Setting up Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD streamlines the delivery of software updates. Developers can automatically trigger builds, run tests, and deploy changes to production or staging environments based on predefined workflows. This results in faster time-to-market for new features and bug fixes.

6. Monitoring and Analytics with Prometheus and Grafana: Integrating Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization provides real-time insights into system performance, application metrics, and infrastructure health. This proactive monitoring helps identify issues promptly, optimize resource usage, and ensure high availability of services.

7. Overall Efficiency and Scalability: By implementing these DevOps practices, organizations improve the overall efficiency, scalability, and reliability of their software delivery processes. Teams can focus more on innovation and less on manual tasks, leading to higher productivity and better alignment with business goals

### Link Steps

- [Step 1](#step-1)
1. Launch EC2 Instances
- Master Instance:
Launch an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instance (t2.micro).
Assign a security group allowing inbound traffic on SSH (port 22) for administration.
- Slave Instances (x2):
Launch two additional Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instances (t2.micro).
Assign the same security group as the master instance.
